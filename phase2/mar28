Opening 
cold opening first email
second email is introduction email. 
how to reply to an information request, how to get the next step, culture fit, technical, code challenge, objection time (you're too young...etc)

say I'm applying to coding house
Subject: "I loveCoding House!!!"
something to do with title of particular job? which one do you think I'll click on more? "I loveCoding House!!!" . it's interesting. 

another one
subject line would be "who do I talk to?"
it's a call to action. 

soemtimes I put the name of the person in the subject line 

convention, start a sentence in the subject line and continue below. instead of the subject. 

compelling subject lien is important. they're bombarded with emails. 

"
Hey Nick, 
I came across your open position for a Fullstack We Developer. I'm eager to discuss my credentials. I'd like to set up a time to chat with you about said position. 
I'm super interested in working at CodingHouse. I know some previous students who loved working there, and I've been looking to work at a place I can be really excited about.

this one is really short, but feels generic, can be used anywhere. but as far as simplicity goes, it wins. 


let's make a new one. 
subject line:
possible ones would be: 
Hi Nick, 
I love CodingHouse 
Hi Nick- Who should I talk to? 


You didn't use the word hey. There's hello, and hi. Don't want what's up. You're gonna mirror their communication: hey, hello, hi. 
If you're starting off: 
Hey is too friendly. Hello is too formal. Hi is the medium. I like hi. After, you mimic what they do. 

think of the word "I", reference to zero, as a negative, -1. think of "You" as a neautral 0. 
Words like us, we, together, are plus ones, score. Those are words you want to use, coming together of people, ideas. 
You don't want a negative score on your email. Want it to be as positive as you can or at least zero. 
A score of -6 means he's full of himself. 

Email: 

Hi Nick,

  My name is Sanath, a young full stack web developer from the Bay. 

  I have followed your company's growth and story for some time, your mission is awesome- full-immersion web development bootcamp is both a unique and bold method to getting someone from zero to full-stack quickly! 

  I have been coding since in middle school and went to Berkeley. Here are a few projects for you to take a look at https://github.com/SanathMullapudi.

  Let's get in touch this week to see if we can move forward.

Thanks, 
Sanath Mullapudi


now the score is 0. 
What about the word but? It cancels out the sentence. so when you write to people, don't use the wrod put. 

I love you, but there are some things that need to work on. 

Use the word and instead. 

"However is a nice formal but"

other word for and would be "also"
think about it. 

Maybe there are times you want to use but. 
I don't have five years experience but...

indenttion, doesn't really matter. 

alternate for the last sentence: 
Can you introduce me to the right person to chat with? 

Can you? your subconcoius answers yes. "Can I move this projector?" You're answering in your head, "yes". 
If it's can followed by someone a human can fucking do, you're putting a yes in the person's head. 

Here are some links to my portfolio:

It's always can we do the next step for the interview.

Can replace let's with can. Let's is more presumptious, but it may work for you because of your personality. 

You may want to install canned responses to your email or somethiing like yesware. saves a lot of time. 
Yesware
Canned responses 
should isntall that. 

this will cue you on the empty holes so you don't fuck up. 








Rejection email: 

your reply, when someone tells you you suck, "thank you", that's exactly what you say. 

Thank you for your email. 

"fuck you, too" that's one way. 

her skill level, they're not happy with. so she has to sell her passion, drive, for the proejct. come on, baby, let's talk about what's going on here. 

If you can get him to coffee, you might have a job. 

You give them three windows. 

we're not taking no for an answer. if you want soething, fight for it.

Hi Kevin, 

Thank you very much for your thoughtful email! Definitely would love to chat with you this week to get your feedback! 

How is Tuesday from 3-5pm, or Friday from 1pm-6pm? 
=========
^ that's sweet. Not taking a no for an answer. 
Until they stopped responding. Even when sthey stopped, send one more email to check in. People forget you. you have to get back in there. 

story of Danny
I couldn't understand a fucking word he said. 
do you have social sercutiy number? I can't hire you. and You don't know shit. 
He left, next day, comes back into my office and asked for a job. you're confused man, i alked to you yesterday. he came back. by Thursday, we're making fun of him. is he retarded or soemthing? guess who's sitting near me? Danny. security: you know how long he's beetn sitting? he's been peeking in, and I'm just looking away. man, i don't know what i can do for you. "i'll do anything you want, i'll sweep floors, do your laundry" i gave him a broom. "get to work" and things are immaculate. printers, computers, recover, data setup... after that and after taht he now works at brocade. software developer. he has risen through the ranks. reason i took him is he wouldn't go away. i wanted him to go away. danny was at my wedding and i told that story. he told a confession, that nick was just one of them. he got multiple jobs. you weren't the only guy, nick, my dad taught me well. 

The same with your emails! the same with your phone calls! you're not going away. if you suck technically, if they like you, or if they think you work hard... even if it's above your reach, you can still get in by persistence. 

all day long, they'll tell you fuck off. if there's a company you really want to work for, kill them. be persistent mother fuckers. they'll shoot you down all day long, but it's up to you. 


wnat phone, in person. email is hard to sell yourself. you're using email to get them on the phone or in person. 

if it's a place you really want to work for, why not show up in person? 

they will all say no. you have to show your passion. why don't you pick companies you really want to work at? 

can go to companies that you don't like just to practice. 



tone of voice. 
a few guys and gals become monotone on the phone. 
you want them to like you, and set the next meeting. all these people you're talking to, the culture fit should be the easiest to win on. in larger organizations, you need a champion, someone who's got your back, they need to run past the developer team who says "he doesn't know shit" but "hey, i like him. i want to take a risk" you want this champsion on your side. you want this champion to like you. 

what is it they picture? 
roller coaster. where to put the emphasis and where not to put the emphasis. when you're tyring to get somebody to go the next step with you, what are some things you can say? they have list of concerns they go through. they are always be using ats, applicant tracking system. checklist of things you get. has a note section, cumulative section, flagging system. when they're o=dong the first itnerview with you, they have questions they ask you. your job is check those things off for them. 

first thing: 
are you an optimist or pessimist? if you're a pessimist, it's time to fake it, be an optimist on the phone. do you have excitement in your voice? or matter of fact? some people want to hire someone who would they would get beer afterword or found a company with. 

on checklist: 
verbal communication. 

previous experience. 
that's what they'll kil you want. you beat that by projects you've done. 

commitment to your skills, project. 

I've beenw orking 14 hours a day, 6 hours a week, for three months. 
you're showing them your passion. 

trustworthiness. mmpi. cpp. myersbrigg cpp is still popular. when you get hiured or before you get hired... why is that important? your personality is not a weakness. you need to know this to know what you're getting into. 
want matching. 
if someone is introverted, you don't want to "HEY MOTHER FUCKER!!!"
think about that. 

envision, there's an empty seat down the hall with your name on it. 
best thing you can do is put your arsenal together, you're painting picture in minds eye. 
"I really really love this stuff. I can see your company. I'm so ecited about it."
By him sayin gthat one sentence, boom, knock off five points. 




i want you to be building shit. the rest applying. almost the effort of ch1, but at least ch2 effort. that's what i'm asking for. taking it as serious as you are in the program. 

if you're getting turn down for jobs, it's usually technical. maybe you don't have a good enough project to show up. if you're fucking failing at stackoverflow, you counteract with projects. 

we stay in touch as a group after program ends. Mondays at 1. you can use us as references. 

coding house is not what they're here for. they don't care what you went. they care about your skills. 

we're not doing the residency extension anymore. we may have an internship/ apprentenceship open, a three month long contract thing. if you want to work on some projects and think it might work...

i recoomend staying where you want to work at. 

the 6th we clear out. 


how long before follow up? 
3 to 4 days. just reply to the email: 
any word on this?
