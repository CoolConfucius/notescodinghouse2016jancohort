Opening 
cold opening first email
second email is introduction email. 
how to reply to an information request, how to get the next step, culture fit, technical, code challenge, objection time (you're too young...etc)

say I'm applying to coding house
Subject: "I loveCoding House!!!"
something to do with title of particular job? which one do you think I'll click on more? "I loveCoding House!!!" . it's interesting. 

another one
subject line would be "who do I talk to?"
it's a call to action. 

soemtimes I put the name of the person in the subject line 

convention, start a sentence in the subject line and continue below. instead of the subject. 

compelling subject lien is important. they're bombarded with emails. 

"
Hey Nick, 
I came across your open position for a Fullstack We Developer. I'm eager to discuss my credentials. I'd like to set up a time to chat with you about said position. 
I'm super interested in working at CodingHouse. I know some previous students who loved working there, and I've been looking to work at a place I can be really excited about.

this one is really short, but feels generic, can be used anywhere. but as far as simplicity goes, it wins. 


let's make a new one. 
subject line:
possible ones would be: 
Hi Nick, 
I love CodingHouse 
Hi Nick- Who should I talk to? 


You didn't use the word hey. There's hello, and hi. Don't want what's up. You're gonna mirror their communication: hey, hello, hi. 
If you're starting off: 
Hey is too friendly. Hello is too formal. Hi is the medium. I like hi. After, you mimic what they do. 

think of the word "I", reference to zero, as a negative, -1. think of "You" as a neautral 0. 
Words like us, we, together, are plus ones, score. Those are words you want to use, coming together of people, ideas. 
You don't want a negative score on your email. Want it to be as positive as you can or at least zero. 
A score of -6 means he's full of himself. 

Email: 

Hi Nick,

  My name is Sanath, a young full stack web developer from the Bay. 

  I have followed your company's growth and story for some time, your mission is awesome- full-immersion web development bootcamp is both a unique and bold method to getting someone from zero to full-stack quickly! 

  I have been coding since in middle school and went to Berkeley. Here are a few projects for you to take a look at https://github.com/SanathMullapudi.

  Let's get in touch this week to see if we can move forward.

Thanks, 
Sanath Mullapudi


now the score is 0. 
What about the word but? It cancels out the sentence. so when you write to people, don't use the wrod put. 

I love you, but there are some things that need to work on. 

Use the word and instead. 

"However is a nice formal but"

other word for and would be "also"
think about it. 

Maybe there are times you want to use but. 
I don't have five years experience but...

indenttion, doesn't really matter. 

alternate for the last sentence: 
Can you introduce me to the right person to chat with? 

Can you? your subconcoius answers yes. "Can I move this projector?" You're answering in your head, "yes". 
If it's can followed by someone a human can fucking do, you're putting a yes in the person's head. 

Here are some links to my portfolio:

It's always can we do the next step for the interview.

Can replace let's with can. Let's is more presumptious, but it may work for you because of your personality. 

You may want to install canned responses to your email or somethiing like yesware. saves a lot of time. 
Yesware
Canned responses 
should isntall that.
