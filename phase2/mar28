Opening 
cold opening first email
second email is introduction email. 
how to reply to an information request, how to get the next step, culture fit, technical, code challenge, objection time (you're too young...etc)

say I'm applying to coding house
Subject: "I loveCoding House!!!"
something to do with title of particular job? which one do you think I'll click on more? "I loveCoding House!!!" . it's interesting. 

another one
subject line would be "who do I talk to?"
it's a call to action. 

soemtimes I put the name of the person in the subject line 

convention, start a sentence in the subject line and continue below. instead of the subject. 

compelling subject lien is important. they're bombarded with emails.

Hey Nick, 
I came across your open position for a Fullstack We Developer. I'm eager to discuss my credentials. I'd like to set up a time to chat with you about said position. 
I'm super interested in working at CodingHouse. I know some previous students who loved working there, and I've been looking to work at a place I can be really excited about.
